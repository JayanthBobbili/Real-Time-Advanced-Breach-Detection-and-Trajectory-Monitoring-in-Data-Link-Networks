1	Introduction
Data Link Networks are the backbone of the modern defence communication systems, Transmitting the real-time information between the various entities such as dynamic and target objects and the ground control. The MIL-STD 1553 protocol has been widely used in the defence and aerospace systems which facilitate secure and reliable data exchange between the multiple terminals. In such critical environments, real-time monitoring of object trajectories and detecting any type of breach in the network is vital to prevent the system failure or unintended consequences during the military operations (Yanushevsky, 2018) [1]. In this article, the prediction of the ground data’s trajectory using both Machine Learning and Quantum Machine Learning models was more essential due to the large volume of the data generated by defence sensors. These data streams are prone to the loss or the corruption, which could lead to compromise the accuracy of predictions. Thus, a key component of this research which involves by addressing the missing values in the datasets by ensuring the models which can still provide reliable predictions. Traditional breach detection and trajectory monitoring methods are inefficient in real-time in     defence applications due to their reliance on simplified models and assumptions that don’t account for real-world complexities, such as missing data and non-linear patterns. These limitations would make them unsuitable for the high-stakes environment of data link networks which are governed by the MIL-STD 1553 standard. The objective of this research was to develop an advanced machine learning system capable of handling these challenges, ensuring real-time accuracy, robustness and scalability.   The goal of this research is to handle missing data in dynamic object and target datasets using advanced imputation techniques, Prediction of dynamic object trajectories by Using machine learning models such as SVR, RF and quantum machine learning models like QNN. Real-time breach detection and trajectory monitoring to improve its decision-making in defence operations by Integration the QNN model into a GUI For continuous, real-time monitoring within a MIL-STD 1553 based data link network.
By analysing the foundational works of various authors, this article provides a comprehensive understanding of the advancements that have been shaped current defence communication protocols and predictive analytics systems. MIL-STD 1553 is a standard that defines in which it defines the communication protocol for the military avionics systems. The protocol operates as a dual-redundant data bus and allows communication between multiple devices while they ensure low latency and high fault tolerance (Zarchan, 2012) [12]. This standard is crucial in defence scenarios where reliable communication is critical. Data loss or corruption in such systems could lead to mission failure or unintended breaches in security, making the need for robust detection mechanisms even more critical. In breach detection and trajectory monitoring, MIL-STD 1553 provides a structured format for handling the complex interactions between the dynamic objects and their targets. The standard ensures that data exchanges are fast and secure, but also it highlights the importance of real-time monitoring solutions that can detect and mitigate potential failures in the network. 
Traditional methods of trajectory monitoring underperform in these dynamic environments, necessitating more sophisticated machine learning techniques capable of real-time processing.

Fig.1. Data Link Network Architecture

In the above Fig.1. It illustrates a real-time data communication system for dynamic object tracking. Data Flows from on-field transmitters through a main server, various interfaces and transceivers, ultimately reaches the laptop that stores and processes the live data. The system incorporates serial communication protocols to enable real-time monitoring and analysis of ground data’s trajectory.



The ability of machine learning models to predict the behaviour of dynamic objects in real-time has been explored extensively in the defence sector. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic models, are not always suitable for real-world applications where environmental variables and uncertainties play a significant role. SVR is an extension of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), used for regression tasks. It constructs a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space to predict continuous variables. SVR is particularly effective in scenarios where the dataset is small, yet complex, as it works well with non-linear data (Vapnik, 1998) [9]. It has been successfully implemented in aerospace applications to predict trajectories based on historical data, providing high accuracy when the system is stable and noise-free.  Random Forest is a widely used ensemble learning method that aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees to generate accurate predictions. It is robust to overfit and performs well at missing temporal gaps in the data, making it an ideal choice for real-time trajectory prediction in noisy environments (Breiman, 2001) [7]. 

In the defence industry, RF has been employed for time series forecasting and trajectory predictions where it excels in capturing non-linear relationships in the data. Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) represent the frontier of machine learning, combining classical neural networks with the principles of quantum mechanics. QNNs leverage quantum states to process vast amounts of data in parallel, allowing for faster computation and potentially more accurate predictions in the complex environments (Wittek, 2019) [10]. Though still in its early stages, QNN has shown significant potential in applications requiring real-time decision-making, such as path guidance and breach detection in defence systems. Missing data is a common challenge in real-time systems due to sensor faults, data transmission errors, or environmental disruptions. Handling missing data is crucial for ensuring the reliability of machine learning predictions. There are several methods to handle missing data, including mean substitution, forward filling and interpolation.

For this research article, cubic spline interpolation was chosen due to it generate smooth transitions between known data points, effectively reconstructing the missing values in the datasets. This technique is highly suited for continuous data, as it minimizes the introduction of artificial noise into the system, ensuring that these predictions remain robust despite the missing values.



     2      Methodology of Development 

The data was pre-processed to remove anomalies and handle the missing values, a critical step given the nature of real-time data acquisition in defence environments. Cubic spline interpolation was used to reconstruct missing data points, ensuring that the dataset remained continuous. Once the data was cleaned and imputed, it was normalized to bring all the variables onto a common scale. This is essential for ensuring that ML & QML models like SVR, RF and QNN are not biased towards variables with larger scales.

Three main models were implemented to predict dynamic object trajectories and identify potential breaches in the data link network.
SVR was implemented in MATLAB due to its efficient handling of high-dimensional, non-linear datasets. By leveraging kernel functions, SVR was able to predict the future positions of dynamic objects with high accuracy, even in the presence of small amounts of noise. This article highlights the use of kernel functions to handle non-linearity, which is crucial for trajectory prediction of dynamic objects in real time. SVR makes appropriate choice for stable systems where data corruption or loss is minimal.

RF was implemented in python using the scikit-learn library. It excelled in scenarios where the dataset was longer or more complex, handling missing data effectively through its ensemble structure. The RF model was able to capture complex relationships between variables and made robust predictions in highly dynamic environments. RF aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.  The ensemble method helps avoid overfitting, which can be more challenging with ground data.
